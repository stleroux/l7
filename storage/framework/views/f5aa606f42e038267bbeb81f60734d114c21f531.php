   The aim of this game is to be the first player to hit all the numbers on the dart board from 1 - 20. Any segment of the number - single, double or triple - counts as a hit. The numbers must be hit in order, and players change after three throws.  A player cannot pass or skip certain numbers, they must hit it to advance to the next number on the board.
