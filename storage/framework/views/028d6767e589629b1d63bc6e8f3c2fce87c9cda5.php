<div class="p-1 bg-dark">How to Play</div>

<div>
   Each player takes turns throwing their three darts at the number associated with that inning. So in the first inning, all darts should be thrown at the number 1 on the dartboard. A hit in the single section scores 1 run, the double is worth 2 runs, and the triple is worth 3. If a dart hits outside of the 1 is worth 0.
   <br />
   Once all players have had their chance at the number 1, the inning is over, and you move onto the second where the number 2 becomes the scoring target. This continues until you have completed a total of 9 innings.
