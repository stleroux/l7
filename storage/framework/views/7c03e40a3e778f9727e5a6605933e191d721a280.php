<div class="p-1 bg-dark">How to Win</div>

<div>
   Players must hit all the numbers in order up to 20, then the final target is the bullseye. The player who completes this sequence first is the winner.
   <br />
   If a tie occurs, players will throw extra rounds of three darts. Players need to hit the red inner bullseye and the player who hits the most bullseyes wins the match.
