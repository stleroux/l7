<div class="p-1 bg-dark">How to Play</div>

<div>
	Each round, the players get 3 darts to try to hit their number, and “build” their castle. If they are able to hit their number the marker will mark a check in one of their castle bricks. Doubles count as two bricks and triples count as three. So it is possible to score 9 bricks in one round (three triples)
	<br />
	At any time, a player may decide to knock down an opponent’s castle by landing their dart in the opponent’s number. If a dart lands in an opponent’s number, a check is removed from their castle. The same rules for doubles and triples apply.
