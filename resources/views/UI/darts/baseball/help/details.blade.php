	Baseball is an excellent dart game for beginning players. It forces you to aim at more of the unused spaces on the dartboard. It keeps you moving all around the board and helps you learn the numbering as you play.

	It is not just for beginners, as even the best players need practice in these lesser-used targets on the board. It not only helps to increases accuracy, but it also focuses on the triples.
